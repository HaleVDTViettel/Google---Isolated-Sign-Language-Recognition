Project: Smart Recycling Assistant (SRA)
Field of Study: Software Engineering (SE)

Request 1: Detailed Description

Project Title: Smart Recycling Assistant (SRA)

Project Purpose/Objectives (Unique): Develop an AI-powered mobile application (app) that helps users identify recyclable items and provides information on local recycling programs.  The unique aspect is the use of image recognition to automate waste identification.

Project Timeframe (Temporary):  6 months (flexible depending on testing and refinement)

Customer/Sponsor: City Department of Sanitation (assumed)

Project Milestones (Time Constraints):

Month 1: Finalize app functionalities and design.
Month 2: Develop image recognition model for waste identification.
Month 3: Integrate model with app and conduct internal testing.
Month 4: User testing and feedback refinement.
Month 5: Pilot launch in a designated area with local residents.
Month 6: Analyze pilot results and prepare final report with recommendations for city-wide deployment.
Other Project Constraints:

Cost: Budget to be determined (may include software development tools, cloud storage, and user testing incentives)
Resources: Project team with expertise in mobile app development, AI/machine learning, and user interface (UI)/user experience (UX) design.
Request 2: Project Organization

Current Organization (assumed): City Department of Sanitation might partner with a university research lab or a private software development company to leverage their expertise in AI and app development.
Recommended Organization: An ideal team would combine the Sanitation Department's knowledge of local recycling programs with the technical expertise of a research lab or a company specializing in AI and user-friendly mobile app development. This collaboration would ensure the app aligns with the department's goals while offering a user-friendly and effective experience.
Request 3: Project Risks

Risk:  Inaccurate Image Recognition:

Probability: Medium (AI models require extensive training data for high accuracy)
Impact: High (users may be confused or misinformed leading to incorrect recycling practices)
Response: Implement a feedback mechanism within the app to allow users to report misidentified items. Utilize the feedback data to continuously improve the accuracy of the image recognition model.
Risk: Low User Adoption:

Probability: Medium (user behavior change can be challenging)
Impact: Medium (reduced project impact if users don't find the app valuable)
Response: Develop a comprehensive marketing campaign targeting residents. Partner with community organizations to promote the app and its benefits.
Risk: Limited Recycling Infrastructure:

Probability: Low (assuming the Sanitation Department has already assessed this)
Impact: High (app becomes useless if residents lack access to proper recycling options)
Response: The app can include a feature that allows users to report any issues with local recycling programs, such as missing bins or unclear guidelines. This feedback can be used by the Sanitation Department to improve their services.

critical path analysis can be used to identify the minimum project duration and the tasks that are critical to completing the project on time. Here's an analysis of the project schedule and how to potentially recover from a 3-week delay:

a) Minimum Project Duration

Following the critical path method (CPM) involves  identifying the longest path through the project tasks. Each path's length is the sum of the durations of the activities on that path. The critical path is the path with the longest total duration.

From the table in the image, we can see the following:

Critical Path: Start -> A -> B -> C -> F -> G -> H -> End (Total Duration: 18 weeks)
The critical path includes activities A, B, C, F, G, and H. Any delay in these activities will directly cause a delay in the project completion. The minimum project duration is therefore 18 weeks.

b) Recovering from a 3-week Delay at Week 8

If the project experiences a 3-week delay by week 8, where activity B is being executed,  there are a couple of solutions to get back on track:

Solution 1: Crash Activity B

Explanation:  Crashing refers to applying additional resources to shorten the duration of a critical path activity. In this case, we would need to find ways to shorten activity B. This might involve assigning more developers to B, extending working hours, or streamlining the development process if possible.

Impact: Crashing often comes with an increased cost.  Adding more developers or extending working hours may lead to higher payroll expenses. There's also a risk of sacrificing code quality by rushing through development.

Assumptions:  This solution assumes that crashing activity B is possible.  It may not be feasible to significantly shorten B's duration depending on the nature of the work involved.

Solution 2: Reduce Scope by Modifying Success Criteria

Explanation:  This approach would involve reducing the functionalities or features planned for the app.  Negotiate with the customer (Sanitation Department) to identify features that can be deferred to a later release  to shorten the development timeline.

Impact: Reducing features may limit the initial usefulness of the app. This  could potentially affect user adoption if the core functionalities are not considered valuable.  There may also be a need to revisit the project plan and update the critical path analysis after scope changes.

Assumptions: This solution assumes the Sanitation Department is flexible and willing to accept a reduced feature set in the initial version of the app.

Both solutions have trade-offs. Crashing may be risky but avoids compromising on features. Reducing scope may be less risky but could affect the initial impact of the project. The best course of action depends on the specific constraints  and priorities of the project.

Project Cost and Schedule Status and Forecast
Calculations:

Percent of Work Completed:

Workload Completed = $3,000
Budgeted Work for this Phase = $5,000 (assuming the $5,000 budget is allocated evenly across the 12 months)
Percent of Work Completed = ($3,000 / $5,000) * 100% = 60%
Cost Performance Index (CPI):

CPI = Earned Value (Work Completed) / Actual Cost
CPI = $3,000 / $4,000 = 0.75
Schedule Performance Index (SPI):

SPI = Planned Duration (Time elapsed) / Budgeted Cost (Actual Cost)
Since we don't have information on specific planned durations for each phase, we can't calculate SPI definitively. However, assuming a linear budget allocation across 12 months, we can estimate:
Planned Duration for this Phase = 1 Month (out of 12)
SPI (estimated) = 1 Month / ($4,000 / $9,000) = 2.25
Comments on Current Status:

Cost: The project is currently over budget based on the CPI of 0.75. This means the project is spending money faster than planned for the amount of work completed.
Schedule: Based on the estimated SPI of 2.25, the project seems to be ahead of schedule. However, this is an estimate and relies on the assumption of a linear budget allocation. We need more information on planned durations to definitively assess the schedule performance.
Forecast to Complete the Project:

Cost: To forecast the total project cost at completion, we can use the Estimated at Completion (EAC) formula:
EAC = Actual Cost + (Budget at Completion / CPI)
Since the budget at completion is the total project budget of $9,000 and CPI is 0.75:
EAC = $4,000 + ($9,000 / 0.75) = $16,000
This forecast suggests the project could significantly exceed the original budget by $7,000.

Schedule: Forecasting the schedule is more challenging without a clear picture of planned durations and potential delays caused by cost overruns. However, given the cost overrun and potential need for additional resources to catch up, there's a high chance the project might also experience schedule delays.
Overall, the project seems to be at risk of exceeding both budget and schedule. It's crucial to take corrective actions to address the cost overrun and assess the potential impact on the timeline.

Recommendations:

Analyze the reasons behind the cost overrun. Are there unexpected expenses? Is the team taking longer than expected to complete tasks?
Identify cost-saving measures. Can features be deferred or simplified? Can alternative resources be found?
Re-evaluate the schedule considering the cost overrun and potential resource limitations.
Communicate the situation and potential risks to the project sponsor (Sanitation Department) and discuss potential adjustments to the budget or schedule.
Implement stricter cost controls and performance monitoring to ensure the project stays on track in the remaining months.
